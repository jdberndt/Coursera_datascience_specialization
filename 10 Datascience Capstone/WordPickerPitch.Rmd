- There is no annual fee.

## WordPicker Pro {.smaller}
We developed WordPicker Pro as the **ultimate** solution to the world's autocomplete needs. Our analysis suggests that the total number of users will exceed Earth's population within three years. So, get in on the ground floor, invest now.  

```{r plot, out.width= "75%", fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
y <- (1:10000)^2.5
st <- as.Date("2018-9-26")
en <- as.Date("2021-9-26")
ll <- seq(st, en, along.with = y)
qplot(ll,y)+geom_line()+geom_abline(intercept=7.7e9, slope=0.0007,linetype="dashed", color = "red", size =2)+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels =  "%b %Y") +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+labs(x = "", y = "number of people")+geom_text(aes(x=as.Date("2019-2-6"), y = 8.5e9), label = "population", color = "red", size = 6)+geom_text(aes(x=as.Date("2018-12-26"), y = 0.5e9), label = "users", size = 6)
```

Some limitations may apply:  
  
- R is not the best language for iOS or Android application development.  
- The text used as the basis for the predictions is old and somewhat irrelevant.  
- We were not able to implement tab-completion; so you'll have to type the word you want anyway.  
- The algorithm is overly simplistic due to limitations of the shinyapps.io server.  
- Our competitors consist of large teams of developers with years of experience.  
- Usage growth after 2021 is entirely dependent on contact with extraterrestrial beings or a massive population boom.

P.S. This slide doesn't count toward the five slide limit.  
P.P.S. I know this is ioslides, not R presentation. Please forgive me.
